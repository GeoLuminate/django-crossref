## About

Django Crossref is a Django application designed to make it easy to query, download, store and manage publications from the Crossref api. This project was inspired by `django-publications` and some code is sourced from that project.

## Goals

* Roughly mirror the public api of the Crossref database
* Query publications direct from Crossref using DOI
* Clean and save queried objects to a local database table to avoid successive queries to Crossref
* Allow customisable in-text citations and bibliography
* Integration with Django-CMS for front-end citations
